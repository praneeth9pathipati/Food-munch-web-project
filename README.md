## Introduction

The **Food-munch-WEB-Project** is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for displaying food items and categories, allowing users to browse, filter, and select their favorite dishes easily. It utilizes modern web technologies like **React** for frontend and follows an organized backend structure. This project serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to dive into web development with React.

---

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the detailed steps below.

### First Step: Extraction

After downloading the zip file of the project from the repository, extract the contents to a suitable location on your system. Ensure that all files and folders are intact.

### Second Step: Project Folder Setup

Navigate to the extracted project folder, which should be named `food-web`. Open this folder in your preferred code editor, such as **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**.

```bash
cd food-web
code .
```

### Third Step: Terminal Setup

For efficient development, it is recommended to split your terminal into two sectionsâ€”one for running the **frontend** and the other for running the **backend**.

- **Frontend Terminal**: This will handle the user interface and rendering part.
- **Backend Terminal**: This will manage the server and database operations.

### Fourth Step: Backend Setup

In the terminal dedicated to the backend, navigate to the backend directory using the following command:

```bash
cd ./backend
```

Once in the `backend` folder, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

After the dependencies have been installed, run the backend server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This should start the backend server, making it accessible on a local port (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

### Fifth Step: Frontend Setup

In the other terminal, dedicated to the frontend, run the following command to start the React application:

```bash
npm start
```

Your frontend server will now run at `http://localhost:3000`. Copy that URL and paste it into your browser to view the website. The page will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source files.

---

## Available Scripts

The following scripts are available for this project and can be executed from the terminal.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in your browser. The app will reload automatically when you make changes to the code, and any lint errors will appear in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. This allows you to run unit tests continuously as you make changes to the code.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for cache-busting.

### `npm run eject`

This command gives you full control over the project configuration by copying all dependencies and configuration files. However, once you eject, you can't go back!

## Additional Features

### Code Splitting

Code-splitting helps improve the load time of your application by splitting your code into smaller chunks. You can learn more about code-splitting in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting).

### Progressive Web App

This project can be converted into a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing users to install it on their devices like a native app. More details are available [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app).

### Bundle Size Analysis

You can analyze the size of your application bundle by using tools like **Webpack Bundle Analyzer** to identify large dependencies and optimize your app. More information can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size).

### Advanced Configuration

For more advanced configurations and optimizations, you can modify the project setup after ejecting it from the default settings. Details on how to configure various settings are available [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration).

---

## Deployment

The app is ready to be deployed once you run the `npm run build` command. After the build, the static files can be hosted on any web server.

For more information on deployment, please refer to [Create React App deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

## Common Issues

### Build Fails to Minify

If the build fails to minify during production, it is likely due to outdated dependencies or incorrect ES6+ syntax. Troubleshooting tips are available [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify).
